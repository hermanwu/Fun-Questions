31. Next Permutation

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

39. Combination Sum

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

Note:
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ? a2 ? … ? ak).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7,
A solution set is:
[7]
[2, 2, 3]
